Most of the children are motivated when doing PE although a few children lack confidence. The school has a small gymnasium with some moveable apparatus (benches, boxes) that the children can use to balance on as well as floor mats to work on. Music can be used if required to add stimulus to the sequences. Work cards with examples of partner balances are available. These have descriptions and images of partner balances along with suggestions of how to get into and out of the balances. The children will have already selected a partner and will have been working on developing travelling with a partner (mirroring and matching movements, moving in different directions) and jumping combinations (using different types of jumps and different shapes). They have started to put a sequence together which they will build on over the following weeks. The lesson aims to encourage students to explore a range of partner balances, modify them if possible and then link them together as part of their partner sequence. The learning outcomes for the lesson cover four areas:\n1.\tPhysical/Move – To perform a variety of challenging partner balances that can be linked to their partner sequence.\n2.\tAffective/Feel – To gain confidence in performing increasingly challenging partner balances and motivation to try more challenging partner balances.\n3.\tCognitive/Think – To consider examples of partner balances and create their own versions, which will link into their partner sequence.\n4.\tSocial/Connect - To work cooperatively in creating and refining challenging partner balances that are added to their partner sequence.';
