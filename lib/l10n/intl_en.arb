The children will have already selected a partner and will have been working on developing travelling with a partner (mirroring and matching movements, moving in different directions) and jumping combinations (using different types of jumps and different shapes). They have started to put a sequence together which they will build on over the following weeks. The lesson aims to encourage students to explore a range of partner balances, modify them if possible and then link them together as part of their partner sequence. The learning outcomes for the lesson cover four areas:\n1.\tPhysical/Move – To perform a variety of challenging partner balances that can be linked to their partner sequence.\n2.\tAffective/Feel – To gain confidence in performing increasingly challenging partner balances and motivation to try more challenging partner balances.\n3.\tCognitive/Think – To consider examples of partner balances and create their own versions, which will link into their partner sequence.\n4.\tSocial/Connect - To work cooperatively in creating and refining challenging partner balances that are added to their partner sequence.",
